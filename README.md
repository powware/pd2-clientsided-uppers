#### What it does:

Clientsided Uppers aims at fixing the delay of deploying a FirstAidKit (FAK) as a client with high ping towards the host. During the time it takes to get an answer of the host to actually place down the FAK, the FAK is not interactable nor does it trigger Uppers, so it is possible to effectively go down on a FAK because of network lag.
With this mod FAKs get deployed clientsided, this means they are placed instantaneously with visuals, are interactable and trigger Uppers.
